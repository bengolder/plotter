## Development

1. Make sure `pipenv` is installed and available on your command line
2. clone this repository, and `cd` into it.
3. `pipenv install` to install all core dependencies or `pipenv install --dev` to install development dependencies.


## Running tests

This is still a proof-of-concept so there aren't any significant tests.

```sh
pipenv run test
```
